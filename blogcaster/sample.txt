By request, this is a FULL MONEY PREORDER. If you really want to buy a spot in line for the v2, I'm not going to say no. This will be a 4x5090 machine, other specs TBD, but others will be the same or better than tinybox green v1. I make no promises when it will ship, we are at the whim of NVIDIA for when we receive the GPUs.

If you buy this, you'll be the absolute first to receive these computers, shipping in order of wires received.
Price increased 16% due to the impact of tariffs, and if it continues I expect prices will increase again. Lock in at $29,000 now!

The tinybox is a very powerful computer for deep learning, and likely the best performance/$. It was benchmarked in MLPerf Training 4.0 vs computers that cost 10x as much. And of course, anything that can train can do inference.
